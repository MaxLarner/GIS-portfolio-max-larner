# Welcome

This portfolio showcases two geospatial data science projects completed during my final year GIS module at the University of Manchester. Each project was developed using **Python**, **GeoPandas**, and open-source tools to solve real-world spatial problems through custom algorithms and visual outputs.

My goal was to build efficient, replicable workflows that reflect both geospatial thinking and technical writing. This site is designed to demonstrate those skills to future employers.

## Projects

### [World's Shortest Border Algorithm](assignment1/assignment1.qmd)
Identify the shortest shared land border between any two countries using spatial indexing and geodesic geometry. This project highlights algorithm design, working with GeoPandas objects, and code structure.

### [Jonny Huck's Spatial Redistribution](assignment2/assignment2.qmd)
An implementation of Jonny Huck's (2014) Spatial Redistribution Algorithm, using a weighting layer to redistribute spatially ambigious point data.

## About Me

I'm a final-year geography student with strong interests in spatial data science, conservation biology, and sustainable development. My academic work focuses on Python-based GIS, GIS informed conservation management, and applying technical skills to real-world environmental challenges.
