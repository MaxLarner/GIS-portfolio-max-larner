The task involved writing a custom script to:\n\nDetect shared borders between countries\nMeasure their geodesic length\nProduce a high-quality map of the shortest result"

This greatly increased performance by reducing unnecessary calculations.\nGeodesic Measurement\nApplied WGS84 geodesic calculations using PyProj’s Geod class for realistic, curvature-aware border length measurement without needing frequent reprojections.\nCRS Handling\nDistance calculations were performed in WGS84, while the final map was reprojected to a dynamic UTM zone estimated from the border location to ensure spatial accuracy in rendering.\nMap Design\nThe map included the two countries, their shared border, a legend, north arrow, and scalebar. A buffer limited surrounding features, focusing attention on the result."
